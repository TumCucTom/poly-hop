Build a 2D low-bit (8- or 16-bit style) platformer game in the browser where players control a customizable character using full-body movements tracked via their webcam.

üïπÔ∏è Core Features:

Retro pixel-art platformer gameplay (jumping, running, ducking, etc.)

Character is controlled using body tracking powered by MediaPipe (jumping = jump, lean left is move left, lean right is move right, ducking is ducking)

Customizable characters: let users select or design pixel avatars (skin tone, outfit, hair, etc.)

Run entirely in the browser (client-side), no server required.

Use Polygon blockchain to mint characters

use simple node family framework

MediaPipe / PoseNet for webcam-based pose estimation

p5.js or Phaser for the platformer engine

give it a fun retro terraria / mario look
